# Glove-Controlled Robotic Hand
My project is a glove-controlled robotic hand, which is a hand that takes information from a glove covered in flex sensors to move. It is intended to be able to hold objects and display musical techniques.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was adding a glove covered in flex sensors and making it compatible with my prototype hand. Flex sensors are plastic strips with layers of carbon that conduct electricity. When the sensor is bent, the carbon is stretched and increases the resistance of the current going through the sensor. This information is sent to the Arduino, and my code translates that information into servo angles so that, when the sensor is bent, the servos will move. 

I liked learning more about coding, including how to format if else statements and printing to the serial monitor to analyze what information is sent from the flex sensors. I struggled with coding and wiring the flex sensors, as I mixed up the pins of the flex sensors and wired them to the wrong ends of the power source, and labeled the sensors as outputs rather than inputs. This has helped me remember to double-check the way I put parts into the breadboard and understand that sensors are inputs because they give information to the system rather than take it. I also struggled because my prototype hand is not precise and moves sloppily. I have completed 3D designs so that I can have a more refined hand for my next milestone.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was constructing the hand out of styrofoam, connecting the servos, and coding it so that it would move. Essentially, each finger has a spring and string running through it. When the string is pulled, the finger bends, and when the string is released, the spring pulls the finger up to its original position. The servos are used to pull on the string. While I was able to eventually construct a hand, it was a very messy process and the parts don't move as precisely as I would have liked. I am now planning to design 3D printed parts to use instead for the final version of my project. Until now, I have had very little coding and circuit experience, so there was a learning curve with wiring and coding the servos. There is a lot of info I have run into that I have yet to understand, but I managed to make the fingers appear to move at the same time through moving each servo after the other at small, fast intervals.

I liked learning how the breadboard worked and enjoyed experimenting with different layouts to determine what would work the best. I struggled with assembling the hand. The parts are primarily held together by duct tape and aren't able to withstand the force from the servos pulling on the string, so I had to re-tape frequently. I also struggled with coding, but I did some research on what different functions did and understand how my code works.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the Useless Machine. When the switch on the outside of the box is flipped, it powers a motor that is attached to an arm which moves to flip the switch in the opposite direction, causing the motor to spin in the opposite direction, bringing the arm back to its original position. The motor includes a piece of metal in the middle coiled by wire, which turns it into a magnet when electricity from the batteries runs through it. This magnet is surrounded by another magnet, and each of these magnets has a north pole on one side and a south pole on the other side. When the north side of one magnet meets the north side of the other magnet, the alike forces repel each other, causing the inner magnet to move a half rotation. The motor is able to move another half rotation when electromagnetic energy causes the charges of the poles of the outer magnet to switch, which places the north side of one magnet near the north side of the other magnet, causing the inner magnet to move another half rotation. At this point, the motor has spun a full rotation. This process repeats, allowing the motor to spin.

This project helped me to learn how to sodder, but I had difficulties along the way. While soddering, it was taking me a long time to melt the sodder. Later I realized that I had forgotten to tin the tip of my sodder iron, which was slowing me down and causing me to lose efficiency while soddering. When I started tinning the tip of my iron, I found that the process went by much faster and made mental notes to periodically re-tin my tip when I was soddering.
